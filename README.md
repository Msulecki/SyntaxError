# Fluid Nav

## Live version: [closeup.pl](https://closeup.pl)

This is (was) a navbar underline feature that grow into my personal portfolio site.

## Features

The cool feature of this project is that underline of navbar items is calculated realtime, and there is one instance for all elements. When jumping over links, bar will slide from one to another, even if they are wrapped.
